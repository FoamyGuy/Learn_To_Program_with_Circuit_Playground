# Learn To Program with the Adafruit Circuit Playground

This repository goes along with a series of tutorial videos. Together can teach you the basics concepts of computer programming. 

These tutorials are made to be followed along with an Adafruit Circuit Playground device. Both the Express or Bluefruit work for these tutorials.

 ## Running the code examples:
 There are two main ways that you can run the code examples in this tutorial. 
 
 #### Method 1 via the REPL: 
 - Copy the file(s) that you want to run onto your `CIRCUITPY` drive
 - Open the serial console within Mu, click inside of it and then press ctrl-c a few times
 - Import the the desired example code like this: `import code_0_1_boolean` note that I did include the .py in the name, but otherwise it matches the filename exactly. 
 
 #### Method 2 replacing code.py:
 - Backup/delete or rename the existing `code.py` file if there is one.
 - Copy the file that you want to run onto your `CIRCUITPY` drive
 - Rename it to `code.py` 
 
 
 ## Play around!
 The best way to learn programming is to play around with it. Read code, write code, break code, fix code. You are strongly encouraged to make edits to these example codes. Try changing values to see what happens. Once you get the very basics down practice writing basic programs of your own even if you find them in this tutorial or elsewhere online instead of copy/pasting, you'll get invaluable experience for your fingers and brain. Plus you'll learn all the common things that can go wrong and how to fix them.   
 
 
Happy Tinkering! 


### Thank you to Adafruit for Circuit Python and the Circuit Playground Devices
Circuit Python microcontrollers like the Circuit Playground give you the ability to make pretty lights, or fun sounds, to interact with switches and buttons and motors, all with only a few lines of code. That makes it a perfect tool to learn programming with because you can learn the basics using something that is more fun and interesting than terminal text input / output.
