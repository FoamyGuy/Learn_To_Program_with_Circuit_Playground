#   Comments single and multi-line
# =============================================== #

# Any text that appears after a pound sign, like this line, is a comment.

# The system will ignore comments when it runs the program.
# So you can use them to leave notes to yourself.

hello_world = True  # Comments can appear after code

"""
Lots of programming languages include a multi-line comment that lets a comment
span several lines without needing to put a character at the begining of each
line.

Technically python does not have have a multi-line comment. But it does have
have something which behaves somewhat similar. We'll learn more about
what it is and the differences between them later.

For now just know that you basically use triple quotes, like this paragraph,
to make some text that spans multiple lines that won't have an impact on the
program when it gets run.

# Sometimes you'll see comments that use other
